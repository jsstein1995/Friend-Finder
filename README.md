# Friend-Finder

This app helps you find friends that have similar outlooks on life as you do. This app uses Express. To run Friend-Frinder you will need to clone down the repo and install the following npms.

In the command-line run: 
        "npm install express"
        "npm install body-parser"
        "npm install faker"
        "npm install nodemon"
        
Because this is not a "real" friend finding app we use faker to generate 100 random "friends" for you to match with.

To run the server, in the command-line run "nodemon server.js" which will listen on PORT 8080.

ENJOY!
